<H1><A name=intro>Lex as a Stand-Alone tool</A></H1>
<P>Although Lex is often used as a front-end to a parser,
it has been designed such that it can be used 
stand-alone. Used in this fashion, Lex makes
for a simple but very powerful text processing tool.
<P>In the following discussion, we will be considering lex mostly in
this role, without calling upon it's usual partner, <B><A href=yacc.html>yacc</A></B>.
<H1><A name=struct>Lex Program Structure</A></H1>
<P>A lex program has the following basic structure:
<PRE>
%{
   <EM>C declarations and includes</EM>
%}
   <EM>Lex macro definitions and directives</EM>
%%
   <EM>Lex Specification
   in the form of pattern/action statements like this:</EM>
   keyword    { my_c_code(yytext); }
%%
   <EM>C language program (the rest)</EM>
</PRE>
<P>However, the only mandatory part is the first <CODE>%%</CODE>
<P>The most important part of the Lex program is the 
<EM>Lex Specification</EM>. This is a series of statements of the
form:
<PRE>
<EM>pattern</EM>       <EM>action</EM>
</PRE>
<P>or to put it more practically:
<PRE>
<EM>regular_expression</EM>       <CODE>{ </CODE><EM>C-program statements</EM><CODE> }</CODE>
</PRE>
<P><A name=ripurl>The</A>
simplest Lex program you can write would read the standard
input, write to the standard output, and look something like this:
<PRE>
%%
http:\/\/[^ \n&lt;&gt;&quot;]*	printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,yytext);
.|\n			;

</PRE>
<P>Which is a program which reads the standard input, extracts any
hyper-text references, and writes then to the standard output.
<P>To compile it, save it as <CODE>rip-url.l</CODE>
and run the command:
<PRE>
	make LDLIBS=-ll rip-url
</PRE>
<P>
And it's all done. Finished. You've just created an executable called <CODE>rip-url</CODE>. You can take the rest of the afternoon off.
<P>That was <EM>too</EM> easy. So what did we <EM>really</EM> do?
<HR>
<H1><A name=spec>The Lex Specification</A></H1>
<H2><A name=patterns>Lex Patterns</A></H2>
<P>Lex Patterns are (more or less) standard Unix regular expressions,
after the style of grep, sed, awk, perl etc. See the lex (or flex) man page for
all the gory details, but here's a quick summary:
<DL>
<DT><CODE>alpha_numeric</CODE>
<DD>Most characters are taken litterally, just like the "http" in
our example. This includes all letter, digits, and _, plus several others
They are, in effect, taken to be <B>single character</B> regular expressions
<P>
<DT><CODE>[abcde]</CODE>
<DD>A <B>single character</B> regular expression consisting of any one of
the characters in between the square backets <CODE>[&nbsp;]</CODE>
<P>A range of characters may be specified by using a hyphen, like this
<CODE>[A-Za-z]</CODE>
<BR>To include the hyphen put it first or last in the group, like this
<CODE>[-A-Za-z]</CODE>
<BR>To include a <CODE>]</CODE>, put it first in the group, like this
 <CODE>[]abc-]</CODE>
<P>If the first character is <CODE>^</CODE>, it means any
character <EM>except</EM> those listed.
<P>So the second part of our example
<BR><CODE>[^&nbsp;\n&lt;&gt;"]</CODE>
<BR>means "anything <EM>but</EM> a space, newline,
quote, less-than or greater-than" .
<P>
<DT><CODE>\</CODE>
<DD>Any character following the <CODE>\</CODE> loses it's special
meaning, and is taken litterally.
So the <CODE>\/\/</CODE> in our example really means <CODE>//</CODE>
<P>The <CODE>\</CODE> is also used to specify the following 
special characters
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD><CODE>\a</CODE><TD>0x7<TD>The alert (ie bell) character
<TR><TD><CODE>\b</CODE><TD>0x8<TD>Backspace
<TR><TD><CODE>\f</CODE><TD>0xC<TD>Form Feed
<TR><TD><CODE>\n</CODE><TD>0xA<TD>New Line
<TR><TD><CODE>\r</CODE><TD>0xD<TD>Carridge return
<TR><TD><CODE>\t</CODE><TD>0x9<TD>Tab
<TR><TD><CODE>\v</CODE><TD>0xB<TD>Vertical Tab
<TR><TD><CODE>\0</CODE><TD>0x0<TD>Null character
<TR><TD><CODE>\123</CODE><TD>0x53<TD>octal representation of a character
<TR><TD><CODE>\x53</CODE><TD>0x53<TD>hexadecimal representation of a character
</TABLE>
<P>Caveat: Some of the above may be flex enhancements.
<P>
<DT><CODE>"text"</CODE>
<DD>Characters between the quotes <CODE>""</CODE> lose their special
meanings, and are intpreted litterally. So we could have written the
first part of our pattern as
<CODE>"http://"</CODE>
instead of
<CODE>http:\/\/</CODE>
<P>
<DT><CODE>^</CODE> and <CODE>$</CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>^</CODE> and <CODE>$</CODE> characters constrain
the regular expression to the start or end of the line,
respectivelty.
<P>
<DT><CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>*</CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>*</CODE> imply repetition of the
preceding <B>single character</B> regular expression.
<P><CODE>+&nbsp;</CODE> means "one or more occurances of". 
<BR><CODE>*&nbsp;</CODE> means "zero or more occurances of".
<P>
<DT><CODE>{3,5}</CODE>
<DD>The range expression <CODE>{</CODE><EM>n1</EM><CODE>,</CODE><EM>n2</EM><CODE>}</CODE> 
also implies repetition of the preceding regular expression.
<P><CODE>{3,5}</CODE> means "3 to 5 occurances of".
<BR><CODE>{2,} </CODE> means "2 or more occurances of".
<BR><CODE>{3}  </CODE> means "exactly 3 occurances of".
<P>
<DT><CODE>?</CODE>
<DD>The <CODE>?</CODE> implies that the preceding <B>single character</B>
regular expression is optional.
<BR>In effect, it means "zero or one occurances of".
<P>
<DT><CODE>(</CODE> and <CODE>)</CODE>
<DD>The round backets imply grouping, such that the regular expression
between the brackets is treated as if it was a <B>single character</B>
(or nearly enough). See the discussion of precedence in the flex man-page for
more information.
<P>
<DT><CODE>.</CODE>
<DD>Any single character <EM>except</EM> a newline (\n)
<P>
<DT><CODE>|</CODE> 
<DD>The <CODE>|</CODE> is used to specify a "logical OR" of two 
regular expressions.
The exact text which is OR'd is governed by the precedence
rules, so it's best to use brackets, like this:
<PRE>
	(ftp|http|telnet):\/\/[^ \n&lt;&gt;&quot;]*
</PRE>
<P>
<DT><CODE>/</CODE>
<DD>The is <CODE>/</CODE> is used to specify a "trailing context".
For example, the expression:
<PRE>
	C/-Program
</PRE>
<P>Matches the letter "C" iff it is followed by the text "-Program"
Note that <EM>only</EM> the letter C is matched, and copied to yytext. 
The "-Program" is not consumed by the rule, and will
match subsequent regular expressions, too.
<P>However, for the purposes of deciding the
<A href="#longest">"longest match"</A>, the
whole text "C-Program" is considered.
<P>Putting <CODE>$</CODE> at the end of a regex is the same as
putting <CODE>/\n</CODE>
</DL>
<HR>
<P>Let's examine the 1st pattern in detail:
<BR><CODE>http:\/\/[^ \n&lt;&gt;&quot;]*</CODE>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<TD><CODE>http:</CODE><TD>is taken litterally
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>&nbsp;<TD><CODE>\/\/</CODE><TD>means two slashes <CODE>//</CODE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>&nbsp;<TD><CODE>[^ \n&lt;&gt;&quot;]</CODE><TD>is a character-set, which 
specifies the space, newline,quote or angle brackets. 
However, since the 1st character is a caret ^, these characters are excluded
from the set, and everything else is included.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>&nbsp;<TD><CODE>*</CODE><TD>means zero or more instances of the character-set 
in the preceding <CODE>[...]</CODE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>&nbsp;<TD><CODE>.|\n</CODE><TD>means everything else, one character 
at a time. Since our action consists only of an empty statement ( <CODE>;</CODE> )
the text is just discarded.
</TABLE>
<P>So our regular expression means:
<DL><DT><DD>any string starting with "http://" and  which doesn't
contain a space or <CODE>\n&lt;&gt;&quot;</CODE>
</DL>
<P>It is worth mentioning that, our reg-ex would not match
<PRE>	HTTP://...</PRE>
It is case-sensitive, unless we tell flex to build a case-insensitive
lexer using the "-i" option.
<P>The 2nd pattern-action statement is essential, because lex has
a default action for any text which did not match <EM>any</EM> rule
in the specification. The default action is to print it on the
standard output.
<P><A name=striphtml>This</A>
 can be useful occasionally, if you just want to do a
small modification on the input stream, such as stripping out
html tags, and replacing text eg:
<PRE>
%%
\&lt;[^&gt;]*\&gt;		;
&amp;gt;			putchar('&gt;');
&amp;lt;			putchar('&lt;');
&amp;nbsp;			putchar(' ');
&amp;amp;			putchar('&amp;');
</PRE>
<P>The above lex-specification will discard any text between
angle-brackets (even multi-line text), and print the rest
to the standard output. It is a working lex program, and
you can compile it by saving it as <CODE>strip-html.l</CODE> and compiling it
with:
<PRE>
	make LDLIBS=-ll strip-html
</PRE>
<P>The text matched by the first rule has an action statement which
is simply <CODE>';'</CODE>  ie an empty statement. 
This means that the text is read, but nothing else is done. The matched
text is just 'swallowed' by the lexer.
<P>The remainder of
the text is copied to the output because it does
<EM>not</EM> match <EM>any</EM> rule,
and the default action takes over.
<P>
The above example might be a useful as a front-end to a program which indexes
web-pages.
<HR>
<H2><A name=actions>Lex Actions</A></H2>
<P>Lex Actions are typically just C-program statements.
An action may be a single C-statement (as in our example), or
multiple statements enclosed in curly braces <CODE>{ ... }</CODE>
<P>An action within curly braces <CODE>{ ... }</CODE> can span
multiple lines. No special continuation character is required,
but each extra line should be indented by at least one tab
from the start of the line, like this:
<PRE>
http:\/\/[^ \n&lt;&gt;&quot;]*	{
			printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;,yytext);
			}
.|\n			;
</PRE>
<P>There are some other "special" actions which lex also
understands.
These can be invoked stand-alone, or from within the
C-statements in curly braces <CODE>{ ... }</CODE>.
<DL>
<DT><CODE>ECHO;</CODE>
<DD>print the matched text on the standard output
<P>
<DT><CODE>REJECT;</CODE>
<DD>Do not consume the matched text. Re-interpret the input
and use the "second best" match instead (see also
the section <A href="#prec">Precedence of Lex Patterns</A>).
<BR>This is a lot more complicated than it sounds! Use with caution.
<P>
<DT><CODE><A name=start>BEGIN <EM>state</EM>;</A></CODE>
<DD>Set Lex into the named state (also know as a "start condition").
<BR>Start conditions must be declared in the section
<PRE>
<EM>Lex macro definitions and directives</EM>
</PRE>
<P>Any pattern may be preceded with a start-condition of the
form
<PRE>
	&lt;<EM>state</EM>&gt;
	-- or --
	&lt;<EM>state1</EM>,<EM>state2</EM>,<EM>etc</EM>&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The pattern is only applied when the appropriate state has
been entered. States may be exclusive or inclusive.
<P>An <B>exclusive</B> start-condition is where no other patterns are applied,
except those with the appropriate start-condition.
<BR>An <B>inclusive</B> start-condition is where the rule is
applied <EM>together</EM>
will any other rules which are not constrained by
start-conditions.
<P>Exclusive states are a feature of flex.
<P>Start conditions are a powerful but easy to use feature of lex.
See the man page for more information.
<P>
<DT><CODE>yymore()</CODE>
<DD>Scan for the next pattern as usual, but prepend the
text from this rule on the the yytext variable of the
next rule.
<P>
<DT><CODE>yyless(<EM>n</EM>)</CODE>
<DD>Retain the first <EM>n</EM> characters from this pattern,
but return the rest to the input stream, such that they will be
used in the next pattern-matching operation.
</DL>
<P>Lex also provides a number of variables which we can
use within actions.
<DL>
<DT><CODE>(char *) yytext</CODE>
<DD>This is a copy of the text which matched the current
pattern, as a null-terminated string.
<P>
<DT><CODE>(int) yyleng</CODE>
<DD>This is the length of <CODE>yytext</CODE>
</DL>
<P>Please read the man page on flex for other, more exotic
ways of using actions, and their subtleties.
<H2><A name=prec>Precedence of Lex Patterns</A></H2>
<P>In most situations where we use regular expressions, there
is only one regular expression active at a time.
<P>In the case of a lex specificatoin, there are multiple regular
expressions, all active <EM>at the same time</EM>.
This leads to the situation where a particular piece of text
may be legitimately interpreted by more than one lex pattern.
<P>In order to resolve such ambiguities, lex uses the
following rules of precedence:
<UL>
<LI>The longest possible match is chosen first
(remember that any trailing context is considered part
of the matched-length).
<LI>If two patterns match the same length of text, the
first pattern in the specification is used.
</UL>
<P>Please see the flex man page for further discussion of precedence,
and discussions of the precedence of elements within a lex pattern.
<H2><A name=longest>The "longest match" rule</A></H2>
<P>As was mentioned in above in <A href="#prec"><B>Precedence of Lex Patterns</B></A>,
lex patterns are to be considered "in parallel", and
the longest match is the one which is eventaully chosen and it's
action executed.
<P>This point is worth stressing, as it is the most common cause
of "unexpected behaviour" from a lex-generated program.
<P>In particular, a rule like
<PRE>
	.*	{ ... }
</PRE>
<P>is usually a bad one to use, because <CODE>.*</CODE> would match an
entire line of text, excluding only the trailing <CODE>\n</CODE>,
for EVERY line in the input.
<P>The net effect of this is that any other rules
would not get a look-in. In those instances where <CODE>.*</CODE>
is appropriate, it is best to precede it with a
<A href="#start">start-condition</A>.
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A name=lexc>Interaction between Lex and C</A></H1>
<H2><A name=statemach>Lex is a State-Machine Generator</A></H2>
<P>So far, we've discussed lex as if it interprets the regular expressions
in our lex-specification at run-time, as sed or awk would do.
However, this is not exactly true.
<P>Lex is in reality a C-code generator, more like a compiler
than an interpreter. Our Lex Specification is "compiled" into
C-code.
<P>The C-code Lex generates is in the form of a state-machine,
which processed input character-by-character.
Although this makes debugging tricky, is does have one important
advantage: <EM>Pure, unadulterated, <B>speed</B></EM>.
<P>Consider the case where you are trying to build a Web-Browser.
If you did it the "traditional" way, using (for example)
<CODE>scanf()</CODE> and <CODE>strcmp()</CODE>,
you would get something like this:
<PRE>
while( (c=getchar()) != EOF ) {
    if ( c != '&lt;' ) {
	... write char to screen ...
    } else {
        char tag[20];
       	scanf("%[A-Za-z]",tag);
        if ( strcmp(tag,"HEAD") == 0 ) {
    	    state = HEADER;
        } else if ( strcmp(tag,"H1") == 0 ) {
            ... change font to h1 ...
        } else if ( strcmp(tag,"H2") == 0 ) {
            ... change font to h2 ...
        } else if ( strcmp(tag,"H3") == 0 ) {
            ... change font to h3 ...
        } else if ( strcmp( ...etc
        }
    }
}
</PRE>
<P>So what's wrong with it? Readability for a start, but
that's not our main concern.
<P>Consider the code that is executed when the markup word
&lt;H3&gt; is encountered.
<UL>
<LI>First, the statement:
<BR><CODE>if ( c != '&lt;' )</CODE>
<BR>detects that this
is the start of a markup word.
<LI>Now we scan the first part of the word in using <CODE>scanf()</CODE>
So far, so good.
<LI>Now we compare the string to the text "HEAD". The compare fails,
but not until <CODE>strcmp()</CODE> has compared the 2nd character of the 2 strings
<LI>We do the same again, using "H1". Again, we have to get
to the second character of the strings to determine that
our match has failed
<LI>Eventually, we will get to the "H3" compare, but not before
we have compared <CODE>'H'=='H'</CODE> three times, and discarded the subsequent result.
</UL>
<P>Given that there are dozens of possible markup words, we
could be calling <CODE>strcmp()</CODE> dozens of times.
Worse than than, <CODE>strcmp()</CODE> may have to get several characters into
the compare before returning a negative result.
<P>So it would be better if, instead, we did it like this:
<PRE>
        char tag[20];
       	scanf("%[A-Za-z]",tag);
        if ( tag[0] == 'H' ) {
	    if( tag[1] == 'E' ) {
		if (strcmp(tag,"HEAD") == 0 )
    	            state = HEADER;
	    } else if ( tag[1] == '1' && tag[2] == '\0' ) {
                ... change font to h1 ...
	    } else if ( tag[1] == '2' && tag[2] == '\0' ) {
                ... change font to h2 ...
	    } else if ( tag[1] == '3' && tag[2] == '\0' ) {
                ... change font to h3 ...
</PRE>
<P>Now, we only do the comparision 'H'=='H' once, and go
straight onto the second character. We have, without even
realising it created a state-machine. When we scan the 
character 'H', we go to a new 'state'. Each level of nested-if
statements creates two, additional, sub-states of the 
higher state.
<P>But why settle for nested-if statements?
We can create a top-level
case-statement, with a case for each character A-Z, and have
nested-case statements for processing the 2nd char...etc.
<P>So we now have a high-performance scanner, but we've had to
sacrifice what little readability of our original source-code
still had.
<P>Lex is designed to generate a suitable state-machine based
text analyser, while maintaining readability at the source-level.
<P>So we can have our cake, and eat it, too.

<H2><A name=yylex>Lex generates yylex()</A></H2>
<P>So far, we have been using lex in a "stand-alone" mode,
and linking in the (hitherto mysterious) libl library
using <CODE>LDLIBS=-ll</CODE>
<P>In fact, lex does not generate a complete program.
Lex generates a single function, 
<BR><CODE>(int) yylex()</CODE>
<BR>and some associated global variables.
<P><CODE>yylex()</CODE> reads the input 
indicated by the global variable
<CODE>(FILE*) yyin</CODE>. 
<BR><CODE>yyin</CODE> defaults to the standard input.
<P>When lex reaches the end of the file it is reading, it
calls a function <CODE>(int) yywrap()</CODE>
If <CODE>yywrap()</CODE> returns non-zero, <CODE>yylex()</CODE>
returns a zero value.
If <CODE>yywrap()</CODE> returns zero,
yylex() keeps scanning, from where it left off, with whatever
input is available on <CODE>yyin</CODE>.
This is only useful if <CODE>yywrap()</CODE>
has changed <CODE>yyin</CODE> to provide for additional input.
<P>The library libl (or libfl for flex) provides two functions which 
are needed to complete our stand-alone lex program:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>main()</CODE>
<BR>...which simply calls <CODE>yylex()</CODE>
<LI><CODE>yywrap()</CODE>
<BR>...which always returns non-zero.
</UL>
<P><A name=ripurl2>Let's</A>
 rewrite rip-url such that we do not need the
standard libl, and add a few more features along the way.

</PRE>
<P>We now have
<UL>
<LI>a function <CODE>main()</CODE> which opens the
first file (if specified) and calls <CODE>yylex()</CODE>
<LI>When <CODE>yylex()</CODE> finished with the first file, it
calls <CODE>yywrap()</CODE>, which opens the next file,
and <CODE>yylex()</CODE> continues.
<LI>When <CODE>yywrap()</CODE> has exhausted all the command line arguments,
it returns 1, and <CODE>yylex()</CODE> returns with value 0 (but we don't
use the return value).
</UL>
<P>Moreover, since we have now provided both <CODE>main()</CODE> and
<CODE>yywrap()</CODE>, we no longer need the libl library, and
we can compile rip-url using simply:
<PRE>
	make rip-url
</PRE>
<P>Notice that the libl library (lex library) is required <EM>only</EM>
if we do not provide <CODE>main()</CODE> or <CODE>yywrap()</CODE>. The libl library is not
required for any of the text-processing - this is all done by the
lex-generated C-code.

<H2><A name=return>yylex() and return()</A></H2>
<P>Although none of our examples have so far done so, it is
valid to execute a <CODE>return()</CODE> statement within a lex rule.
<P><CODE>yylex()</CODE> is of type <CODE>int</CODE>, so a non-zero
integer value would normally be returned.
Returning zero would be ambiguous, because the zero value is what is
returned by <CODE>yylex()</CODE> when it encounters and end-of-file,
<EM>and</EM>
<CODE>yywrap()</CODE> returns a non-zero.
<P>After <CODE>yylex()</CODE> has returned, it is possible to call it
again and again, and the scanner will continue exactly where it
left off each time. If any start-condition was in force when
the <CODE>return()</CODE> was executed,
it will still apply when <CODE>yylex()</CODE> is
called again. 
<P>This aspect of <CODE>yylex()</CODE> plays a key role 
when lex is being used as a front-end
to a parser, such as yacc.
<P>When writing a stand-alone lex program, it is generally not required
to have a <CODE>return()</CODE> statement within a lex rule.
<HR>
<H1><A name=examples>Examples of Lex programs</A></H1>
<H2><A name=squid>A Lex squid redirector</A></H2>
<P>If you are using the 
<A href="http://www.nlanr.net/Squid/"><B>Squid</B></A>
http proxy (and who doesn't?) you should be aware that it
supports redirectors.
<P>A squid redirector is a pipe, which is invoked by squid,
fed a line of text at a time, like this:
<PRE>
	url ip-address/fqdn ident method
</PRE>
<P>Where:
<DL>
<DT><CODE>url</CODE>
<DD>is the requested URL
<DT><CODE>ip-address</CODE>
<DD>is the IP-address of the host where the URL request came from
<DT><CODE>fqdn</CODE>
<DD>fully qualified domain-name of the host where the request came from,
if available, otherwise '-'
<DT><CODE>ident</CODE>
<DD>Is the result of the ident_lookup, if enabled in the config file,
otherwise '-'
<DT><CODE>method</CODE>
<DD>is GET, PUT, POST etc.
</DL>
<P>The redirector program writes either a blank line, or a new URL.
In the later case, the new URL is fetched in lieu of the original
(hence "redirector"). The most obvious application is for virtual-hosting,
where a single squid proxy is made to look like serveral different
servers.
<P>Squid redirectors are typically implemented using regular expressions
of some kind. The most obvious tools for implementing redirectors
would be programs like sed, awk or perl.
<P>All of these are really over-kill, in that they use a complex program
to solve a simple problem. As such, they use more memory and CPU
capacity than is strictly necessary.
<P>If you have a busy squid proxy, you would probably want to use
a special C-program to act as your redirector, such as <B>squirm</B> (see
<A href="http://www.senet.com.au/squirm/">http://www.senet.com.au/squirm</A>).
<P>Lex is designed with performance being a major goal. That makes
lex an ideal candidate for implementing a squid-redirector for
a performance-critical application.
<P>The proof of whether or not lex is actually faster than it's
alternatives is "left as an exercise
to the reader" <CODE><B>:-)</B></CODE>

lex-based squid redirector would look something like this:

&lt;SKIP&gt;.			;
&lt;*&gt;\n			{ putchar('\n'); fflush(stdout); BEGIN 0; }
%%
</PRE>
<P>To build the above redirector, save it to a file such as
<CODE>squid-redirector.l</CODE> and build it using:
<PRE>
	make LDLIBS=-ll squid-redirector 
</PRE>
<P>Note that it is vital that the redirector process does not
buffer it's input or output by more than a single line at a time,
otherwise squid will 'hang'.
The line <CODE>%option&nbsp;always-interactive</CODE> takes care of the
input, while the statement <CODE>fflush(stdout);</CODE> takes
care of the output.
<P>Some key features of the above program:
<UL>
<LI>In the first action, we actually modify <CODE>yytext</CODE> before
writing it out. We are free to modify <CODE>yytext</CODE>
as we would any string variable
(with all the usual perils) provided that we do not use
<CODE>yyless()</CODE> afterwards. Refer to the flex man page for
more information. Note in particular the lex-directives
<CODE>%array</CODE> and <CODE>%pointer</CODE> in the documentation,
and how they impact <CODE>yyless()</CODE>
<P>
<LI>The directive <CODE>%option&nbsp;always-interactive</CODE>
is essential in this case. Without it, flex will try to read an extra
character ahead, even after the newline.
In the absence of any character to read, this will result in
the program going into a blocked state
(waiting for input), before it writes out the result of the
current line. This will cause squid to hang.
<BR>The <CODE>%option&nbsp;always-interactive</CODE> tells
flex to do the minimal look-ahead only. In this case, the rule
which contains the newline is unambiguous, and there
is no need for look-ahead. Hence this option prevents unwanted
buffering on the input.
<P>
<LI>After writing the output, we must use <CODE>fflush()</CODE>
to defeat unwanted buffering on the output. Otherwise,
the output will just sit around in a buffer instead of being
sent straight to the squid process. Again, this would cause
squid to hang.
<P>
<LI>The (exclusive) start-condition <CODE>SKIP</CODE> is used to discard
input. This happens when either
<UL>
<LI>the initial text does not match
any of the explicit rules ("http://...").
<LI>after the first space in a URL which is being modified
</UL>
<P>
<LI>If none of our explicit rules (ie "http://...") match,
we use the single-dot rule to put us straight into the state
<CODE>SKIP</CODE>. We are relying on the "longest match"
mechanisim to ensure that the explicit rules are given 
preference over the default rule.
<BR>In this case, we want to
write a blank line instead of a modified URL.
<P>
<LI>If one of our explicit rules (ie "http://...") match,
then we write the first part of the URL using <CODE>printf()</CODE>,
and immediately invoke the
(exclusive) start-condition <CODE>COPY</CODE>.
From here on, 
the rest of the modified URL is copied from the input to the
output (up to the first space).
<BR>The lex macro ECHO is used as a matter of convinience,
<CODE>putchar()</CODE> would be just as good.
<P>
<LI>We could use a non-exclusive start-condition for SKIP,
but then we would have to change the rule to:
<BR><CODE>&lt;SKIP&gt;.*	;</CODE>
<BR>to ensure that the SKIP rule takes precedence over
the other rules, by virtue of being the "longest match" rule.
It would have to appear <EM>before</EM> the other rules too, just to
be safe. 
<P>The same applies for <CODE>COPY</CODE>.
<P>
<LI>The statement <CODE>BEGIN 0;</CODE> is used at every newline
to reset the start-condition to it's "normal" state (ie when no start-condition
applies).
<P>
<LI>The start-condition <CODE>&lt;*&gt;</CODE> means that the
rule <CODE>\n</CODE> applies for <EM>all</EM> start-conditions,
even the exclusive ones <CODE>SKIP</CODE> and <CODE>COPY</CODE>.
<P>
<LI>The redirector creates a synonym "weather" for the
site www.bom.gov.au
<P>
<LI>We have provided a feature whereby we can effectively
bypass our redirector by using, eg http://bypass.www.yahoo.com/
to refer to http://www.yahoo.com/
</UL>
<P>In order to realise the benefits of the lex state-based analysis,
it is important to avoid things like <CODE>yyless(), REJECT</CODE> and any
construct which may result in the lexer doing "backup".
You should read carefully the section "Performance Considerations"
in the flex man-page.
<HR>
<H2><A name=lex.parser>Using yylex() within a parser</A></H2>
<P>Lex is actually designed to be used as a front-end for a
parser. 
Let's look at how a typical parser would use lex.
<P>One statement which we have not considered so far in our
lex actions is the <CODE>return</CODE> statement.
In the simple examples we have considered so far,
putting a <CODE>return</CODE> into an action
would result in a premature end to the file processing.
However, this need not be the case. After <CODE>yylex()</CODE>
returns, we can simply call it again, and processing will
continue exactly where it left off.
<P>This feature of <CODE>yylex()</CODE> is what makes it
suitable as a front-end to a parser.
<P>Lets consider a simple parser, using just C-code.
Our example will be a program which reads an e-mail message,
analyses the headers, and tells us if it is likey to be spam, or not.
<P>Let's use a 100-point check, based on the following
criteria:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>Precedence:</CODE> if it's "bulk", we'll give
it 10 points, if it's "junk" that's worth at least 20 points
<P>
<LI><CODE>From: To: Cc:</CODE> This is the biggest clue. If the
<CODE>To:</CODE> address is the same as the <CODE>From:</CODE>
address, let's add 30 points (if either <CODE>To:</CODE> or <CODE>From:</CODE>
is missing, we'll ad the 30 points anyway).
<P>
<LI>If our user-name is in neither the To nor CC fields, 
then let's add another 30 points.
<P>
<LI>Another clue is if there are lot of recipients.
Lets add 10 points if there are more than 20 recipients.
(Any message sent to more than 10 people
probably isn't worth reading, anyway).
<P>
<LI>Lastly, let's consider the message size. Most
people write reasonably short messages, typically
less than 5k. Spam is often 10k or more.
We'll add 10 points for any message %gt; 5k in size
</UL>
<P>Let's do the lexer first. 
In this case it's fairly simple. It looks for the header
fields <CODE>From From: To: Cc: Precedence: </CODE>
and returns a specific code for each of these.
Any other header-field is returned as "OTHER".
<P>Our lexer is also made to find the e-mail addresses
for us, and return them.
<P>Any other text is returned word-by-word.
<P>The message body is counted by the lexer, but nothing
is returned to the parser.<A name=isitspam>&nbsp;</A>

</PRE>
<P>Since mail-headers and e-mail addresses are supposed to
be case-insensitive, you should compile the above program using
the case-insensitive option of flex:
<PRE>
	make LFLAGS=-i is_spam.l
</PRE>
<P>The parser is implemented in C-code.
The main feature of the parser is the loop:
<PRE>
        while ( (token = yylex()) ) {
                switch(token) {
	...
		}
	}
</PRE>

<P>The parser calls <CODE>yylex()</CODE> repeatedly, processing each token
in turn, tkaing whatever action is appropriate to that token.
When lex reaches the end-of-file, <CODE>yylex()</CODE> returns 0, and the
parser exits it's <CODE>while()</CODE> loop
<P>Where addition information must be transferred between the
lexer and the parser, this is done using global variables.
For example, when the lexer encounters an e-mail address,
it returns the token <CODE>EMAIL</CODE>, but it also places
the actual text into the variable <CODE>token_txt</CODE>,
where the parser can find it.
<P>We will be using the above mechanisms later, when we start
to employ Yacc.
<P>Lex is designed to interwork with Yacc. However, as the
above example tries to show, if we think Yacc may not be
suitable to our needs, we are free to use whatever parser
suits our needs.
<P>By the way, the above program does a pretty poor job of
detecting spam reliably. However, it does illustrate a few key
points of a typical parser.
<HR>
<H1><A name=make>Lex and make</A></H1>
<P>You may have noticed that we have been building our lex-programs
using make, but without having to write a makefile.
<P>This is because lex is on of the programs for which make
has an "implicit rule".
The default make rule for a file ending in ther extension ".l" is
to invoke make on that file, and generate a ".c" file for that
file. From there on, the better known implicit rules for compiling C programs
take over.
<P>The default rule for lex is:
<PRE>
.l.c:
	$(LEX) $(LFLAGS) -t $&lt; &gt; $@
</PRE>
Which usually resolves to something like:
<PRE>
	lex -t file.l &gt; file.c
</PRE>
<HR>
<DL>
<DT><A name=note1>Note 1</A>
<DD>Lex pattern-action statements should be separated by one or
more <STRONG>TAB</STRONG> characters. Flex is not fussy, and will
accept spaces, but some versions of lex need to see tabs as separators.
<P>Similarly, actions which run over more than one line should be
indented by at least one tab.
<P>Also avoid putting blank lines within the lex specification.
Although flex does not have a problem with this, some versions of lex do.
