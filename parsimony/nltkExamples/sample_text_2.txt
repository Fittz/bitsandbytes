"""Mr Blobby is a fictional character who featured on Noel
    Edmonds' Saturday night entertainment show Noel's House Party,
    which was often a ratings winner in the 1990s.
    He was a large pink humanoid, covered with yellow spots, sporting a
    permanent toothy grin and jiggling eyes. He communicated by saying
    the word "blobby" in an electronically-altered voice, expressing
    his moods through tone of voice and repetition."""
