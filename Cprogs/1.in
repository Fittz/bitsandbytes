The Sabines adopted the Roman
system of months, and all
that is remarkable about
them will be found in the
'Life of Numa.' But Romulus
adopted the large oblong
Sabine shield, and gave up
the round Argolic shields
which he and the Romans had
formerly carried. The two
nations shared each other's
festivals, not abolishing any
which either had been wont to
celebrate, but introducing
several new ones, among which
are the Matronalia, instituted
in honour of the women at the
end of the war, and that of
the Carmentalia.
